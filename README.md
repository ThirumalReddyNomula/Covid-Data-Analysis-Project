COVID Data Analysis Project

> Project Overview: Conducted comprehensive data analysis on COVID-19 vaccination and death data using Excel, MySQL Workbench, and Tableau.

> Data Exploration and Insights:

-- Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Analyzed and visualized the relationship between total COVID-19 cases and deaths.
-- Mortality Analysis in the US: Assessed the probability of death among COVID-19 infected individuals in the US.
-- Total Cases vs. Population: Compared total COVID-19 cases to population size across various regions.
-- Infection Rate by Country: Identified the country with the highest infection rate relative to its population.
-- Highest Death Count per Population by Location: Determined locations with the highest death rates relative to their populations.
-- Total Death Counts by Continent: Aggregated death counts across different continents.
-- Highest Death Counts per Population by Continents: Compared death rates per population across continents.
-- Temporal Analysis: Tracked total cases, deaths, and death percentages over time globally.
-- Vaccination Analysis: Joined COVID-19 death data with vaccination data to assess vaccination coverage worldwide.
-- CTE and Rolling Total: Used Common Table Expressions to calculate rolling totals of COVID-19 statistics.
-- Temporary Tables and Views: Created temporary tables and views to compute the percentage of vaccinated population.

> Tableau Dashboard Development:

-- Key Metrics Visualization: Developed dashboards to display total deaths, total cases, and death percentages.
-- Deaths by Continent: Visualized death counts per continent.
-- Infection Rate Visualization: Displayed percentage of population infected by country.
-- Vaccination Insights: Showed the percentage of the population vaccinated.

> Technical Skills:

-- Data Manipulation and Analysis: Proficient in SQL for data manipulation, including joining datasets, using CTEs, and creating temporary tables.
-- Data Visualization: Experienced in creating insightful dashboards using Tableau.
-- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Skilled in cleaning and preparing large datasets in Excel and MySQL Workbench.
